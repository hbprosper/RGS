Description
-----------
Discriminate between VBF and ggF production modes of pp -> H --> 4l events 
using one-sided cuts.

First define environment variables by "sourcing" the setup scripts from the
RGS directory:

    cd RGS
    source setup.sh   (for a bash shell)
        or
    source setup.csh  (for a non-bash shell)
    
(A) Run RGS
    cd examples/example0
    python train.py

output:
    example0.root
    example0.txt

(B) Analyze results of RGS to find best cuts
    python analysis.py
